# Miscellaneous Retail Items

##Task

This program allows the user to choose miscellaneous retail items and then it will calculate the cost depending on how many they would like to purchase. 

##Summary

This program was built using Java and I chose to use jGrasp to accomplish this task due to its powerful developer tooling.

##Functionality

This program starts out implementing a while loop to ensure that the information stays within the number of retail items. It will then ask the user to choose between the the micellaneous items. A switch statement calculates each product to ensure the correct price is used for each individual retail item. The program will then show the unit cost of each product as well as the total order cost.
